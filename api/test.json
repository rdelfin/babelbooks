Few students studying computer science or computer engineering will ever have the opportunity to build a computer system. On the other hand, most students will be required to use and program computers on a near daily basis. Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective introduces the important and enduring concepts that underlie computer systems by showing how these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of application programs. The text's hands-on approach (including a comprehensive set of labs) helps students understand the under-the-hood operation of a modern computer system and prepares them for future courses in systems topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, and networking.",

The Tenth Edition of A Survey of Mathematics with Applications continues the tradition of showing students how we use mathematics in our daily lives and why it’s important, in a clear and accessible way. With straightforward language, detailed examples, and interesting applications, the authors ensure non-majors will relate to the math and understand the mathematical concepts that pervade their lives. With this revision, an expanded media program in MyMathLab, and a new workbook further build upon the tradition of motivating and supporting student learning. Also available with MyMathLab MyMathLab is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed to work with this text to engage students and improve results. Within its structured environment, students practice what they learn, test their understanding, and engage with media resources to help them absorb course material and understand difficult concepts. NEW! This edition’s MyMathLab course provides additional tools to help with understanding and preparedness.
